## ✅ Validation

All 4 fields are **required**, which means:

- ❌ User cannot submit without selecting a payment method
- ❌ User cannot submit without selecting payer type
- ❌ User must check BOTH agreement boxes
- ✅ Form validation runs before submission

---

## 💾 How Data is Stored

When a user submits the form, all data is saved in `registrations.custom_data`:

```json
{
  "custom_data": {
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "payment_method": "Credit/debit card",
    "payer_type": "Person",
    "accept_terms_privacy": true,
    "accept_terms_conference": true
  }
}
```

---

## 🔗 Link Syntax Examples

### Single Link:
```
I accept [Terms of Service](https://example.com/terms)
```

### Multiple Links:
```
I accept [Terms](https://example.com/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://example.com/privacy)
```

### Complex Example:
```
I have read and accept the [Terms of Service](https://example.com/terms), [Privacy Policy](https://example.com/privacy), and [Conference Rules](https://example.com/conference-rules)
```

**Important:** 
- Use square brackets `[]` for link text
- Use parentheses `()` for the URL
- No spaces between `]` and `(`
- All links open in a **new tab** automatically
