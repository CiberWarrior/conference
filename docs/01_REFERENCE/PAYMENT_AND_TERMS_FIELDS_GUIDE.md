# Payment & Terms Fields Guide

This guide shows you how to create **terms/agreement** and **payer type** fields in the Form Builder.

> **Important:** **Payment method** (Pay Now – Card, Pay Now – Bank Transfer, Pay Later) is **not** a custom field. It is configured in **Conference Settings → Payment** (system-level). See `docs/PAYMENT_OPTIONS_GUIDE.md` and `docs/PAYMENT_SETTINGS_IMPLEMENTATION.md`. Do **not** add a "Payment Method" custom field for that.

---

## 🎯 Fields to Create (Form Builder)

You can create these **custom fields** in the Form Builder when needed:

1. **Payer Type** (Radio buttons) – Person / Company
2. **Terms & Privacy Policy Agreement** (Checkbox with links)
3. **Conference Terms Agreement** (Checkbox with links)

*(Previously this guide listed "Payment Method" as a custom field; that is deprecated – use Conference Payment Settings instead.)*

---

## 📝 Field 1: Payer Type (optional)

### Settings:
```
Field Name:      payer_type
Field Type:      Radio Buttons
Label:           Payer
Placeholder:     (leave empty)
Description:     (optional)
Options:         Person
                 Company
Required:        ✅ Yes
```

### How it looks:
```
Payer *
○ Person
○ Company
```

---

## 📝 Field 2: Terms of Service & Privacy Policy

### Settings:
```
Field Name:      accept_terms_privacy
Field Type:      Checkbox
Label:           Agreement
Placeholder:     I accept [Terms of Service](https://yoursite.com/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://yoursite.com/privacy)
Description:     (optional)
Required:        ✅ Yes
```

### Important Notes:
- **Placeholder field** is where the checkbox text goes
- Use markdown syntax for links: `[Link Text](https://url.com)`
- Links will automatically become clickable and open in new tab
- The system converts `[text](url)` to clickable HTML links

### How it looks:
```
☐ I accept Terms of Service and Privacy Policy *
           ↑ these become clickable blue underlined links
```

### Settings:
```
Field Name:      accept_terms_conference
Field Type:      Checkbox
Label:           Conference Agreement

```

### How it looks:

           ↑ clickable links
```

## ✅ Validation

All 4 fields are **required**, which means:

- ❌ User cannot submit without selecting a payment method
- ❌ User cannot submit without selecting payer type
- ❌ User must check BOTH agreement boxes
- ✅ Form validation runs before submission

---

## 💾 How Data is Stored

When a user submits the form, all data is saved in `registrations.custom_data`:

```json
{
  "custom_data": {
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "payment_method": "Credit/debit card",
    "payer_type": "Person",
    "accept_terms_privacy": true,
    "accept_terms_conference": true
  }
}
```

---

## 🔗 Link Syntax Examples

### Single Link:
```
I accept [Terms of Service](https://example.com/terms)
```

### Multiple Links:
```
I accept [Terms](https://example.com/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://example.com/privacy)
```

### Complex Example:
```
I have read and accept the [Terms of Service](https://example.com/terms), [Privacy Policy](https://example.com/privacy), and [Conference Rules](https://example.com/conference-rules)
```

**Important:** 
- Use square brackets `[]` for link text
- Use parentheses `()` for the URL
- No spaces between `]` and `(`
- All links open in a **new tab** automatically
